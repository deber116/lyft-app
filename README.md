# lyft-app

This application was created to meet the requirements of the technical sample section for the Software Engineering Apprenticeship (2022) job application.

The server is written in TypeScript since I have been actively learning and practicing with TypeScript. Since it compiles to JavaScript, I hope it still fits within the language requirements.
